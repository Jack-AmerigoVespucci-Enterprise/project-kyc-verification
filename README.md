# Important Disclaimer

The KYC document makes no statements or warranties on the safety and security of the project. It also cannot be considered as enough assessment regarding the utility and safety of the project, or its rug-free status. While we have used all the data at our disposal to provide transparent verification, it is important to note that you should not rely on the KYC document only — we recommend proceeding with several independent KYC and public verification of the individual and the project. Be aware that InterFi does not guarantee the authenticity of the data, data transmitted by the owner as proof of KYC can be easily altered, modified, forged or imitated. Therefore, InterFi does not guarantee the explicit security of the KYC document.
